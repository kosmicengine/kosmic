# 🌟 Kosmic Engine Authors 🌟

The **Kosmic Engine** is a **fork of the Godot Engine**, created and maintained with lots of love by an incredible community of 
voluntary contributors! 💻 They help in many ways: writing code, reporting bugs, 
documenting, translating, supporting and more in our repositories.  

While it's impossible to list every wonderful person who has contributed (you live in our hearts 🥹❤️), 
This file is intended to highlight people who have made significant contributions to our engine code. ✨  

To maintain organization, the list here only considers those who made **11 or more commits** — but know that each contribution, 
Even the smallest one is super important to us!

**Note:** This list does not reflect copyright ownership of the code, okay? 
If you want details, take a look at Git history to see who wrote each piece of the codebase.  

Oh, and GitHub usernames are in parentheses (or appear alone if we don't have another name).
